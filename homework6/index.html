             <p>A 12 year old girl named Matilda lives with her dysfunctional family and is beaten by her parents and sister but is very protective of her four year old brother. Her father stores drugs for a corrupt agent named Norman Stransfield. Matilda has abandoned school and spends her time at home watching cartoons. One day, Norman Stransfield and his team take revenge on the father because of a drug deal and murder the whole family. Matilda was grocery shopping and upon her arrival at home she witnesses her family killed including her four year old brother. Her only chance for survival is to hide with her neighbor Leon, a professional hitman. Leon lives with his favorite plant and lives an unhappy life. When Matilda learns of his identity she becomes infatuated and desperately seeks his help in learning how to become a hitman in order to take revenge on the crooked cops responsible for her brothers death. What I liked about the movie is how the twelve year old girl keeps you engaged in the movie. Her cleverness and ability to learn from Leon is brilliant. The acting and story were very well played out with much intensity and emotion from all the characters. My favorite scene in Leon the Professional would be when the old lady that is the neighbor comes out and confronts the old DEA agent Norman saying, "Why don't you leave the poor family alone" and Norman replies with a gun shot to the wall and says to the old lady " He says go back inside".</p>
