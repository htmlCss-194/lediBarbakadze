              <p>Mental health is the foundation for emotions, thinking, communication, learning, resilience, hope and self-esteem. Mental health is also key to relationships, personal and emotional well-being and contributing to community or society. Mental health is a component of overall well-being. It can influence and be influenced by physical health. Most scientists believe that mental illnesses result from problems with the communication between neurons in the brain (neurotransmission).</p>

            <p>In some cases, environmental factors impact mental wellness by changing brain structure and function. Research on children supports this, noting that children raised in adverse environments tend to have hindered brain development, increasing their risk of memory issues, learning difficulties, and behavioral problems. Environmental factors can also affect our mental health in the way they impact us psychologically. Your environment might raise or lower your stress levels, for instance.</p>
